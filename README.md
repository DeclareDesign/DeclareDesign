DeclareDesign is statistical software to aid researchers in characterizing and diagnosing research designs â€” including experiments, quasi-experiments, and observational studies.

The motivation for the software is described in a [working paper](/paper.pdf) by the authors.

DeclareDesign consists of a core package, documented on this web site, as well as three companion packages that stand on their own but can also be used to complement the core package. They are:

1. [randomizr](http://randomizr.declaredesign.org): Easy-to-use tools for common forms of random assignment and sampling.
2. [fabricatr](http://fabricatr.declaredesign.org): Tools for fabricating data to enable frontloading analysis decisions in social science research.
3. [estimatr](http://estimatr.declaredesign.org): Fast estimators for social science research.

This software is in alpha release. Please contact the authors before using in experiments or published work.

This project is generously supported by a grant from the [Laura and John Arnold Foundation](http://www.arnoldfoundation.org) and seeding funding from [EGAP](http://egap.org).
