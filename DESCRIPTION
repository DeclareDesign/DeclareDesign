Description: Researchers can characterize and learn about the properties of
    research designs before implementation using `DeclareDesign`. Ex ante
    declaration and diagnosis of designs can help researchers clarify the 
    strengths and limitations of their designs and to improve their 
    properties, and can help readers evaluate a research strategy prior
    to implementation and without access to results. It can also make it
    easier for designs to be shared, replicated, and critiqued.
