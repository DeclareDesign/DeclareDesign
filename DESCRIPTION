Description: DeclareDesign is statistical software that makes it easier for researchers 
   to characterize and learn about the properties of research designs before implementation. 
   Ex ante declaration and diagnosis of designs can help researchers clarify the strengths 
   and limitations of their designs and to improve their properties. It can make it easier 
   for readers to evaluate a research strategy prior to implementation and without access 
   to results. It can also make it easier for designs to be shared, replicated, and critiqued.
